<description>A sociopath is a person who, for whatever reason, cannot feel emotions. They function by replicating behaviors in their life. In this sermon, Greg shows how religion can sometimes be sociopathic, and we are called to not judge others' behaviors. &lt;ol class="ol1"&gt;

<description>Greg started this week's sermon with a reminder of how central love is to the Christian faith. The Church is to display God's love to the world. But we fail to do this primarily because we forget that we are unable to both love and judge our neighbor.</description>

<description>Greg picked up where he left off about a month ago with the theme of love, which he has been contrasting to 'the knowledge of good and evil.' He used the story of the woman who washed Jesus' feet in the Pharisee's house (read Luke 7:31-50) as an illustration of the difference between relating to others in love vs. relating to others through our own knowledge of good and evil.</description>

<description>Love is to be the heartbeat of the Christian life. We have also seen that we cannot both love and judge at the same time. We either eat of the tree of life, which is made available to us again in Jesus Christ, or we continue to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. One is a life of freedom, transparency, openness, joy and truth. The other is a life of bondage and emptiness. This second way of trying to get life will drive us to pretend to be something that we are not. We are called to a life of love, but most of us seem to live in a pattern of performance and hiding.</description>

<description>Greg has been preaching on passion for the past month as a way of preparing us for the release of this passion of faith through spiritual disciplines and obedience to God in our lives. Today we were reminded that love is the power that validates any act of obedience or discipline that a Christian does. If we don't have love, nothing else we do can have the impact God wants it to have.</description>
